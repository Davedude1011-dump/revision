            <div class="header">Amylase: Digesting Carbohydrates</div>
            <div class="text">Amylase is a critical enzyme responsible for breaking down carbohydrates during digestion. It is produced in various parts of the digestive system, including the salivary glands and pancreas. Amylase plays a crucial role in converting complex carbohydrates, primarily starches, into simpler sugars that the body can absorb and use as a source of energy.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Amylase</div>
            <div class="text">There are two main types of amylase: salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase. Salivary amylase is found in saliva and initiates carbohydrate digestion in the mouth. Pancreatic amylase is secreted by the pancreas and continues carbohydrate digestion in the small intestine, specifically breaking down maltose into glucose.</div>

            <div class="header">Lipase: Breaking Down Fats</div>
            <div class="text">Lipase is an essential digestive enzyme responsible for the breakdown of dietary fats. It is primarily produced in the pancreas and the small intestine. Lipase's main role is to cleave triglycerides, the primary fats in our diet, into glycerol and fatty acids, making them easier for absorption in the intestines. This process allows the body to utilize fats for energy and other metabolic functions.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Lipase</div>
            <div class="text">There are different types of lipase, including pancreatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase. Pancreatic lipase is responsible for breaking down triglycerides in dietary fats, while lipoprotein lipase is involved in processing lipids circulating in the bloodstream. Both play essential roles in lipid metabolism.</div>

            <div class="header">Protease: Protein Digestion</div>
            <div class="text">Protease enzymes are critical for the digestion of proteins. They are produced in various parts of the digestive system, including the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine. Proteases work by breaking down complex protein structures into smaller peptides and individual amino acids, which can be absorbed and used by the body for various physiological processes.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Protease</div>
            <div class="text">There are several types of protease enzymes, each with its specific functions. In the stomach, pepsin is a prominent acidic protease responsible for initiating protein digestion by cleaving peptide bonds. In the small intestine, trypsin and chymotrypsin, produced in the pancreas, further break down peptides into individual amino acids, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream.</div>

            <div class="header">Combined Action: Complete Digestion</div>
            <div class="text">The digestive process is highly coordinated, with amylase, lipase, and protease enzymes working in synergy to ensure the complete digestion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This breakdown of macronutrients is essential for the absorption of vital nutrients in the small intestine, where they enter the bloodstream and support various bodily functions.</div>

            <div class="header">Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity</div>
            <div class="text">Enzyme activity can be influenced by various factors, including pH levels and temperature. Amylase functions optimally in slightly alkaline conditions, while lipase works best in a slightly acidic environment. Protease enzymes operate optimally in acidic conditions in the stomach.</div>

            <div class="header">Regulation of Enzyme Production</div>
            <div class="text">The production and release of digestive enzymes are regulated by hormones and nervous system signals. For instance, the hormone gastrin stimulates the release of gastric juices containing protease enzymes in response to the presence of proteins in the stomach.</div>

            <div class="header">Clinical Implications</div>
            <div class="text">Digestive enzyme deficiencies, such as pancreatic insufficiency, can lead to malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies. In such cases, enzyme supplements may be prescribed to support proper digestion and nutrient absorption.</div>
