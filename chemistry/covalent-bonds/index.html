            <div class="header">Chapter 1: Introduction to Covalent Bonds</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent bonds occur when atoms share electrons to achieve stable electron configurations. Unlike ionic bonds, which involve electron transfer, covalent bonds result from the simultaneous sharing of electrons. This sharing leads to the formation of molecules, where atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds. Key differences between covalent and ionic bonds include electron sharing versus electron transfer.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 2: How Covalent Bonds Work</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent bonds are based on the principle of electron sharing, allowing atoms to achieve full outer electron shells, typically containing eight electrons (following the octet rule). Valence electrons, the outermost electrons, participate in bonding. This chapter explores how atoms share electrons to form covalent bonds, enabling a stable electron configuration.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 3: Forces in Covalent Bonds</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent bonds involve the electrostatic attraction between atomic nuclei and shared electrons. This force holds atoms together within molecules. Bond strength depends on factors like the number of shared electrons and interatomic distances. Understanding these forces is essential for comprehending covalent compound properties.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 4: Drawing Covalent Bonds</div>
            <div class="text">Lewis structures offer a graphical representation of covalent bonds, depicting atom arrangements and shared electrons. Drawing Lewis structures involves assigning valence electrons, forming bonds (lines), and adhering to the octet rule. This skill aids in understanding molecular structure and predicting chemical reactions.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 5: Displayed Formula in Covalent Bonds</div>
            <div class="text">Displayed formulas provide detailed notations for covalent compounds, illustrating atom connectivity and bond arrangements. Covalent bonds are represented as lines (-) between atoms, identified by chemical symbols. Displayed formulas offer a comprehensive view of molecular structures, aiding in the analysis of complex molecules.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 6: Three-Dimensional Structure of Covalent Compounds</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent compounds exist in three-dimensional space, adopting various shapes. Understanding spatial arrangements and bond angles is crucial for predicting molecular properties. Common molecular geometries include linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral shapes, each determined by atom arrangement and bond angles.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 7: Different Covalent Bonding Structures</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent bonds come in various forms, including single, double, and triple bonds. These result from varying degrees of electron sharing. Such structural diversity significantly influences molecular properties and reactivity, playing a vital role in chemical reactions.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 8: Covalent Bonding Example - Water (H2O)</div>
            <div class="text">Water (H2O) serves as a prime example of covalent bonding. Oxygen and hydrogen atoms share electrons to create this molecule. This electron sharing results in the unique properties of water, including its high polarity, which leads to hydrogen bonding and various essential features for life.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 9: Covalent Bonding Example - Methane (CH4)</div>
            <div class="text">Methane (CH4) exemplifies covalent bonding in hydrocarbons. Carbon and hydrogen atoms share electrons, forming covalent bonds. The molecule takes on a tetrahedral shape due to electron distribution. Methane is a critical component of natural gas and plays a role in various industrial processes.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 10: Covalent Bonding Example - Ethylene (C2H4)</div>
            <div class="text">Ethylene (C2H4) showcases covalent bonding with a double bond between carbon atoms. These carbon atoms share two pairs of electrons, resulting in a planar molecular geometry. Ethylene is utilized in the chemical industry and plays a role in plant biology, influencing fruit ripening and growth regulation.</div>
