            <div class="header">Chapter 1: Introduction to Binary Subtraction</div>
            <div class="text">Binary subtraction is a fundamental operation in digital computing. It involves finding the difference between two binary numbers. Unlike decimal subtraction, which uses ten digits (0-9), binary subtraction operates with just two: 0 and 1. To subtract binary numbers, you'll compare each digit position and apply specific rules.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 2: Binary Subtraction Basics</div>
            <div class="text">In binary subtraction, you subtract corresponding digits, just like in decimal subtraction. Key rules include: 0 - 0 = 0, 1 - 0 = 1, and 1 - 1 = 0. When subtracting a smaller digit from a larger one, borrowing may be necessary, similar to carrying in binary addition. This chapter covers the fundamental rules of binary subtraction.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 3: Borrowing in Binary Subtraction</div>
            <div class="text">Borrowing is a critical concept in binary subtraction. When you need to subtract a larger digit from a smaller one, you borrow 2 (which is 10 in binary) from the next higher place value. This borrowed 2 is added to the digit you're subtracting from, allowing you to complete the subtraction accurately. Understanding the borrowing process is essential for more complex binary subtractions.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 4: Binary Subtraction Examples</div>
            <div class="text">Let's practice binary subtraction with concrete examples. We'll go through step-by-step demonstrations, ranging from simple subtractions to cases involving multiple borrows. These examples will help you grasp the nuances of binary subtraction and build confidence in performing it.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 5: Binary Subtraction with Overflow</div>
            <div class="text">Binary subtraction, like addition, can result in overflow. This occurs when the result exceeds the bit capacity. Recognizing and addressing overflow is vital. Strategies include increasing the bit size, truncating the result, or using two's complement notation for signed numbers. Handling overflow ensures accurate results in computer arithmetic.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 6: Binary Subtraction in Computers</div>
            <div class="text">Binary subtraction is a fundamental operation in computer systems. Modern processors execute binary subtraction as part of various computational tasks. Understanding how binary subtraction is implemented in computer hardware is essential for programmers and engineers. It contributes to data processing, arithmetic operations, and more.</div>
