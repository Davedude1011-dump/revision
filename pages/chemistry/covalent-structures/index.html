            <div class="header">Small and Large Covalent Structures</div>
            <div class="text">Covalent structures are chemical compounds composed of atoms bound together by covalent bonds. These structures can vary widely in size and complexity, with two primary categories: small covalent molecules and large covalent structures, also known as macromolecules.</div>

            <div class="header">Small Covalent Molecules</div>
            <div class="text">Small covalent molecules consist of a relatively small number of atoms bonded together. They are characterized by discrete molecular units held together by covalent bonds. Here are some key features of small covalent molecules:</div>

            <div class="text">1. **Low Molecular Weight:** Small covalent molecules typically have low molecular weights due to their limited number of atoms.</div>

            <div class="text">2. **Gas, Liquid, or Solid State:** Depending on the nature of the atoms and the strength of the intermolecular forces, small covalent molecules can exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature.</div>

            <div class="text">3. **Examples:** Common examples of small covalent molecules include water (H₂O), methane (CH₄), oxygen (O₂), and carbon dioxide (CO₂).</div>

            <div class="header">Large Covalent Structures (Macromolecules)</div>
            <div class="text">Large covalent structures, or macromolecules, are characterized by an extensive network of covalent bonds, forming a repeating structure. These structures can consist of thousands to millions of atoms. Here are some key features of large covalent structures:</div>

            <div class="text">1. **High Molecular Weight:** Macromolecules have high molecular weights due to their extensive size and the presence of a large number of atoms.</div>

            <div class="text">2. **Solid State:** Large covalent structures are typically solids at room temperature and may have various crystalline or amorphous arrangements.</div>

            <div class="text">3. **Strong Covalent Bonds:** The covalent bonds within macromolecules are strong, requiring a significant amount of energy to break.</div>

            <div class="text">4. **Examples:** Common examples of large covalent structures include diamond (a pure carbon lattice), graphite (another form of carbon), and various polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene.</div>

            <div class="header">Key Differences</div>
            <div class="text">The primary differences between small covalent molecules and large covalent structures lie in their size, molecular weight, state of matter, and the nature of their covalent bonds. Small covalent molecules are relatively small, have low molecular weights, and can exist as gases, liquids, or solids. In contrast, large covalent structures are significantly larger, have high molecular weights, and are typically solid at room temperature due to their strong covalent bonds and extensive networks.</div>

            <div class="header">Applications</div>
            <div class="text">Both small covalent molecules and large covalent structures play essential roles in various fields of chemistry and industry. Small covalent molecules are involved in chemical reactions, while large covalent structures are used in materials science, electronics, and engineering.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Understanding the differences between small and large covalent structures is fundamental in chemistry and materials science. These structures have unique properties and applications that make them significant in various scientific and industrial contexts.</div>
