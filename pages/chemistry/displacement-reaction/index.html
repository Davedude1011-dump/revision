            <div class="header">Displacement Reactions</div>
            <div class="text">Displacement reactions are fundamental chemical reactions where one element displaces another from a compound. These reactions are crucial in understanding the reactivity of elements and have practical applications in various fields.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Principle of Displacement Reactions</div>
            <div class="text">The principle of displacement reactions is based on the reactivity series. In this series, elements are ranked in order of their reactivity. A more reactive element can displace a less reactive element from its compound, leading to the formation of a new compound.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Example of Displacement Reaction</div>
            <div class="text">One classic example of a displacement reaction involves zinc displacing copper from copper sulfate. The equation for this reaction is:</div>
            <div class="text">Zn + CuSO4 â†’ ZnSO4 + Cu</div>
            <div class="text">Here, zinc (Zn) is more reactive than copper (Cu), so it displaces copper from the copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution, leading to the formation of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and copper metal (Cu).</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Applications</div>
            <div class="text">Displacement reactions find applications in various areas:</div>
            <div class="text">1. <i>Metallurgy:</i> Displacement reactions are essential in extracting metals from their ores. For example, iron is extracted from iron ore (Fe2O3) using carbon as a reducing agent in a displacement reaction.</div>
            <div class="text">2. <i>Single Replacement Reactions:</i> These reactions are commonly used in chemical synthesis and in educational experiments to demonstrate the reactivity of different elements.</div>
            <div class="text">3. <i>Corrosion Prevention:</i> Sacrificial anodes made of more reactive metals are used to protect ships and pipelines from corrosion. In these systems, the sacrificial anode undergoes a displacement reaction to prevent the corrosion of the structure.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Double Displacement Reactions</div>
            <div class="text">In some cases, double displacement reactions occur when two compounds exchange ions. These reactions are common in precipitation and neutralization reactions, where two new compounds are formed as a result.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Examples of Double Displacement Reactions</div>
            <div class="text">1. <i>Precipitation Reaction:</i> When sodium chloride (NaCl) is mixed with silver nitrate (AgNO3), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms, while sodium nitrate (NaNO3) remains in solution.</div>
            <div class="text">2. <i>Neutralization Reaction:</i> In an acid-base neutralization reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O) are formed.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Displacement reactions are pivotal in chemistry and are used to understand the reactivity of elements and their compounds. They have significant applications in various industries, from metallurgy to corrosion prevention and chemical synthesis.</div>
