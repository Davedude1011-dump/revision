            <div class="header">Understanding Ionic Bonding</div>
            <div class="text">Ionic bonding is a fundamental type of chemical bonding that occurs when atoms transfer electrons to form ions. It is often observed between elements with significantly different electronegativities.</div>
            <div class="text">In ionic bonding, one atom becomes positively charged (cation), and the other becomes negatively charged (anion). These oppositely charged ions are held together by electrostatic forces, resulting in the formation of an ionic compound.</div>

            <div class="header">Formation of Ions</div>
            <div class="text">To understand ionic bonding, it's crucial to know how ions are formed. Ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons, leading to an imbalance between protons and electrons.</div>
            <div class="text">1. Cations: Atoms that lose electrons become positively charged cations. For example, sodium (Na) has one valence electron and loses it to become Na<sup>+</sup> cation.</div>
            <div class="text">2. Anions: Atoms that gain electrons become negatively charged anions. Chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to become Cl<sup>-</sup> anion.</div>

            <div class="header">Ionic Bond Formation</div>
            <div class="text">Ionic bonds form between a cation and an anion. The strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions holds them together.</div>
            <div class="text">For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and chlorine (Cl<sup>-</sup>) ions combine to form a stable compound:</div>

            <div class="header">Predicting Ionic Compounds</div>
            <div class="text">You can predict the ionic compounds that form by looking at the elements' positions on the periodic table.</div>
            <div class="text">1. Metals (left side of the periodic table) tend to lose electrons to become cations.</div>
            <div class="text">2. Nonmetals (right side of the periodic table) tend to gain electrons to become anions.</div>
            <div class="text">3. Ionic compounds often form between elements with large differences in electronegativity, such as sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl).</div>

            <div class="header">Ionic Bonding Properties</div>
            <div class="text">Ionic compounds have several characteristic properties:</div>
            <div class="text">1. High Melting and Boiling Points: Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic forces between ions, requiring a lot of energy to break them apart.</div>
            <div class="text">2. Solubility: Many ionic compounds dissolve in water because water molecules surround and separate the ions.</div>
            <div class="text">3. Conductivity: In their molten or dissolved state, ionic compounds can conduct electricity because ions are free to move and carry charge.</div>
            <div class="text">4. Crystalline Structure: Ionic compounds often have a repeating, orderly arrangement of ions in a crystal lattice.</div>

            <div class="header">Ionic Bonding in Everyday Life</div>
            <div class="text">Ionic compounds are ubiquitous in daily life. Common examples include table salt (NaCl), which is used in cooking, and sodium chloride (NaCl), which is used in water softeners. These compounds also play crucial roles in biology and industry.</div>
            <div class="text">Understanding ionic bonding is foundational in chemistry and provides insight into the properties and behavior of many compounds found in our world.</div>
