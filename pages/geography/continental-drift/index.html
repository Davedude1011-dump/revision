            <div class="header">Continental Drift and Tectonic Plates</div>
            <div class="text">Continental drift and the theory of plate tectonics are fundamental concepts in geology that explain the movement of Earth's continents and the formation of various landforms. This comprehensive exploration covers multiple aspects of these phenomena.</div>

            <div class="header">Alfred Wegener and Continental Drift</div>
            <div class="text">Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift in the early 20th century. He believed that continents were once part of a supercontinent called Pangaea and that they drifted apart over millions of years.</div>
            <div class="text">Wegener's groundbreaking idea was met with skepticism initially, but his work laid the foundation for the modern theory of plate tectonics, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's dynamic processes.</div>

            <div class="header">Evidence for Continental Drift</div>
            <div class="text">Various lines of evidence support the theory of continental drift, including fossil records, geological formations, and the fit of continents. For example, identical fossils have been found on continents separated by vast oceans.</div>
            <div class="text">Furthermore, the coastlines of continents, particularly the eastern coast of South America and the western coast of Africa, seem to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, providing compelling evidence for their past connection.</div>

            <div class="header">The Earth's Interior</div>
            <div class="text">Understanding the Earth's interior is crucial for comprehending plate tectonics. The Earth consists of distinct layers, including the core, mantle, and crust, each with its unique properties and characteristics.</div>
            <div class="text">The solid inner core, composed mainly of iron and nickel, is surrounded by a liquid outer core. Above the core is the mantle, which exhibits semi-fluid behavior and plays a critical role in plate movements. The outermost layer, the crust, is divided into tectonic plates that interact with each other.</div>

            <div class="header">Plate Tectonics Theory</div>
            <div class="text">The theory of plate tectonics explains the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. These plates, which include both continents and oceanic crust, float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them.</div>
            <div class="text">Plate tectonics theory suggests that the lithospheric plates are in constant motion, driven by convection currents in the underlying mantle. This movement leads to the creation and destruction of geological features, including mountain ranges, ocean basins, and earthquakes.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Plate Boundaries</div>
            <div class="text">Plate boundaries are regions where tectonic plates interact. There are three primary types of plate boundaries: divergent boundaries (moving apart), convergent boundaries (coming together), and transform boundaries (sliding past each other).</div>
            <div class="text">Divergent boundaries occur along mid-ocean ridges, where plates separate and new crust is formed. Convergent boundaries are associated with subduction zones, where one plate is forced beneath another. Transform boundaries involve lateral movement along fault lines.</div>

            <div class="header">Convection Currents</div>
            <div class="text">Convection currents in the mantle are responsible for driving the movement of tectonic plates. As material in the mantle heats up and rises, it pushes plates apart at divergent boundaries.</div>
            <div class="text">Conversely, cooling and sinking material in the mantle pulls plates together at convergent boundaries. The dynamic interplay of these convection currents creates the intricate pattern of plate movements observed on Earth's surface.</div>

            <div class="header">Plate Movements and Landforms</div>
            <div class="text">The movement of tectonic plates creates various landforms and geological features. Examples include mountain ranges formed at convergent boundaries, ocean basins at divergent boundaries, and fault lines at transform boundaries.</div>
            <div class="text">These landforms are the result of millions of years of plate interactions and provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history and the processes shaping its surface.</div>

            <div class="header">Plate Tectonics and Natural Disasters</div>
            <div class="text">Tectonic plate movements are responsible for natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impact of such events.</div>
            <div class="text">Earthquakes occur when stress along fault lines is released, leading to seismic waves. Volcanic eruptions result from the movement of molten rock (magma) from the mantle to the surface. Tsunamis can be triggered by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, generating massive ocean waves.</div>

            <div class="header">Plate Tectonics and Earth's History</div>
            <div class="text">The movement of tectonic plates has shaped Earth's geological history, influencing the distribution of continents, climate patterns, and the evolution of life. It plays a critical role in understanding the planet's past.</div>
            <div class="text">For example, the breakup of Pangaea and the movement of continents have had profound effects on Earth's biodiversity and climate over millions of years. Plate tectonics provides a framework for studying these historical changes.</div>

            <div class="header">Ongoing Research and Future Insights</div>
            <div class="text">Continued research into continental drift and plate tectonics is expanding our knowledge of Earth's dynamic processes. Ongoing studies explore the causes of plate movements, the impacts of climate change, and more.</div>
            <div class="text">Scientists use advanced technologies such as GPS, seismology, and satellite imagery to monitor plate movements and gain insights into geological phenomena. This research informs our understanding of Earth's present and future.</div>
