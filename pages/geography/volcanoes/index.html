            <div class="header">Volcanoes: Nature's Fury</div>
            <div class="text">Volcanoes are natural wonders that captivate our curiosity and shape our world. They are geological formations where molten rock, ash, and gases escape from the Earth's interior to the surface. The word "volcano" comes from the Roman god of fire, Vulcan, and these fiery mountains have fascinated and terrified people throughout history.</div>

            <div class="header">Formation of Volcanoes</div>
            <div class="text">Volcanoes form as a result of tectonic plate movements, where the Earth's lithosphere is fractured and molten rock, known as magma, rises from the mantle. This magma can erupt violently or slowly build up to create volcanic mountains over time. Volcanoes are most commonly found along the boundaries of tectonic plates.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Volcanoes</div>
            <div class="text">There are several types of volcanoes, each with unique characteristics. Some of the most common types include:</div>

            <div class="text">1. <strong>Stratovolcanoes:</strong> These are tall and conical volcanoes characterized by their explosive eruptions and alternating layers of ash, lava, and rocks.</div>

            <div class="text">2. <strong>Shield Volcanoes:</strong> These are broad and low-profile volcanoes formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava. They have a shield-like appearance.</div>

            <div class="text">3. <strong>Cinder Cone Volcanoes:</strong> These are small, steep-sided volcanoes composed of volcanic debris, such as ash, cinders, and volcanic rocks.</div>

            <div class="header">Volcanic Hazards</div>
            <div class="text">Volcanoes can pose various hazards to human populations and the environment. These hazards include:</div>

            <div class="text">1. <strong>Lava Flows:</strong> Molten lava can flow down the sides of a volcano, destroying everything in its path.</div>

            <div class="text">2. <strong>Pyroclastic Flows:</strong> A mix of superheated gases, ash, and rock fragments that rush down the slopes at high speeds, incinerating everything in their way.</div>

            <div class="text">3. <strong>Ashfall:</strong> Volcanic ash can blanket large areas, disrupting transportation, damaging buildings, and impacting respiratory health.</div>

            <div class="text">4. <strong>Lahars:</strong> Mudflows or debris flows triggered by volcanic activity, often caused by melting snow and ice on the volcano.</div>

            <div class="text">5. <strong>Gases:</strong> Volcanic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, can have harmful effects on air quality and human health.</div>

            <div class="text">6. <strong>Climate Impact:</strong> Major volcanic eruptions can release enough ash and aerosols into the atmosphere to temporarily cool the planet.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Volcanoes are dynamic geological features that play a significant role in shaping the Earth's surface and influencing the environment. Understanding their formation, types, and associated hazards is essential for the safety of populations living near volcanic regions and for the study of Earth's natural processes.</div>
