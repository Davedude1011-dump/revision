            <div class="header">Plate Margins: Earth's Tectonic Boundaries</div>
            <div class="text">The Earth's lithosphere is divided into several large plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. These plates are constantly in motion, and their interactions at plate margins or boundaries play a pivotal role in shaping the Earth's surface and geological phenomena. Plate margins can be categorized into three main types: destructive, constructive, and conservative.</div>

            <div class="header">Destructive Plate Margins</div>
            <div class="text">Destructive plate margins, also known as convergent boundaries, occur when two tectonic plates move toward each other. The collision and subduction of plates lead to various geological features and hazards:</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Subduction Zones:</strong> In these regions, one plate is forced beneath another, leading to the formation of deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs. Subduction zones are associated with powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Mountain Building:</strong> The intense pressure and friction at convergent boundaries can lead to the uplift of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas.</div>

            <div class="header">Constructive Plate Margins</div>
            <div class="text">Constructive plate margins, also called divergent boundaries, occur when two plates move away from each other. This movement results in the creation of new crust and geological features:</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Mid-Ocean Ridges:</strong> These underwater mountain ranges are formed as new oceanic crust is produced and spreads apart. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a prominent example.</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Rift Valleys:</strong> On continents, divergent boundaries can create rift valleys, where the lithosphere is stretched and pulled apart. The East African Rift is an ongoing example.</div>

            <div class="header">Conservative Plate Margins</div>
            <div class="text">Conservative plate margins, or transform boundaries, occur when two plates slide past each other horizontally. This lateral motion can result in geological features and phenomena:</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Transform Faults:</strong> These are fractures or fault zones where the plates grind against each other. The San Andreas Fault in California is a well-known transform boundary.</div>

            <div class="text">- <strong>Earthquakes:</strong> The intense friction at transform boundaries can lead to frequent and sometimes powerful earthquakes as built-up stress is suddenly released.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Plate margins represent the dynamic interactions between Earth's tectonic plates, leading to a wide range of geological phenomena, from mountain building to earthquakes and volcanic activity. Understanding these boundaries is crucial for studying Earth's geology and mitigating the impact of associated hazards.</div>
