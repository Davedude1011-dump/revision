            <div class="header">Earthquakes in LICs vs. HICs: A Comparative Study</div>
            <div class="text">Earthquakes are natural disasters that can strike any region of the world, but their impacts can vary significantly between Low-Income Countries (LICs) and High-Income Countries (HICs). This comparative analysis focuses on two seismic events: the 2010 Haiti earthquake (LIC) and the 2011 New Zealand earthquake (HIC), highlighting the disparities in preparedness, response, and recovery.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 1: Vulnerability and Preparedness</div>
            <div class="text">LICs like Haiti often face higher vulnerability due to factors such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to healthcare, and densely populated urban areas. In contrast, HICs like New Zealand have well-established building codes, early warning systems, and emergency response plans in place.</div>
            <div class="text">Haiti's vulnerability was evident in the 2010 earthquake, resulting in severe casualties and extensive damage. New Zealand's earthquake resilience, on the other hand, helped minimize the impact of the 2011 event.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 2: Building Infrastructure</div>
            <div class="text">HICs invest heavily in earthquake-resistant building infrastructure. New Zealand's stringent building codes require structures to withstand seismic forces. Conversely, LICs may lack resources for such measures, leading to poorly constructed buildings that are susceptible to collapse during earthquakes.</div>
            <div class="text">The 2010 Haiti earthquake revealed the devastating consequences of substandard construction, with numerous casualties and widespread destruction. In New Zealand, the earthquake-resistant buildings played a crucial role in limiting casualties and property damage during the 2011 earthquake.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 3: Emergency Response and Healthcare</div>
            <div class="text">HICs generally have well-equipped emergency response teams, access to medical facilities, and the capacity to provide timely assistance. LICs often struggle with limited resources for disaster response and healthcare, resulting in delays in aid delivery.</div>
            <div class="text">The response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake faced significant challenges, including a lack of medical supplies and personnel. In New Zealand, the well-organized emergency response effectively managed the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, providing prompt medical care and assistance to affected communities.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 4: Economic Impact and Recovery</div>
            <div class="text">LICs typically suffer more profound economic impacts from earthquakes due to their limited financial resources. Rebuilding and recovery in LICs can be slow and resource-intensive. HICs like New Zealand have insurance systems and financial capacity to expedite recovery.</div>
            <div class="text">The economic toll of the 2010 Haiti earthquake was substantial, and the recovery process was lengthy. New Zealand's economy, although affected by the 2011 earthquake, rebounded more swiftly due to its economic resilience and resources.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 5: Costs of Rebuilding Better Building</div>
            <div class="text">After the 2011 earthquake in New Zealand, the country incurred significant costs in rebuilding, primarily due to the construction of earthquake-resistant buildings. While this investment contributed to lower casualties and damage, it came at a high price.</div>
            <div class="text">In contrast, Haiti faced enormous challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure after the 2010 earthquake, largely due to limited financial resources and the need for comprehensive reconstruction.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 6: Primary and Secondary Effects</div>
            <div class="text">Earthquakes have both primary and secondary effects. Primary effects include ground shaking, surface ruptures, and direct structural damage. Secondary effects encompass tsunamis, landslides, fires, and aftershocks.</div>
            <div class="text">In LICs, primary effects often lead to more immediate challenges, including casualties and the displacement of populations. Secondary effects, such as looting during crises, can exacerbate the situation, as law enforcement and security may be limited.</div>
            <div class="text">In HICs, while primary effects are better managed due to preparedness, secondary effects can still pose significant challenges. For example, aftershocks can hamper recovery efforts, and landslides may block critical transportation routes. However, the overall impact on social order and security is often less severe.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 7: International Assistance</div>
            <div class="text">LICs often receive more extensive international assistance in the aftermath of earthquakes due to their limited capacity to manage large-scale disasters. HICs may receive less international assistance but have better internal resources for response and recovery.</div>
            <div class="text">Haiti received substantial international aid after the 2010 earthquake, including humanitarian assistance and reconstruction support. New Zealand relied more on its internal resources and expertise but received some international assistance in specialized areas.</div>
            
            <div class="header">Chapter 8: Statistical Comparisons</div>
            <div class="text">Statistical data highlights the contrasting impact of earthquakes in LICs and HICs.</div>
