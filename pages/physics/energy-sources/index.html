            <div class="header">Energy Sources</div>
            <div class="text">Energy sources are essential for powering our modern world. They can be categorized into two main groups: renewable and non-renewable energy sources. Each source has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and understanding these is crucial for making informed decisions about energy production and consumption.</div>

            <div class="header">Renewable Energy Sources</div>
            <div class="text">Renewable energy sources are those that can be naturally replenished over time and have a minimal environmental impact. They offer sustainable solutions for meeting our energy needs. Here are some common examples:</div>

            <div class="header">1. Solar Energy</div>
            <div class="text">Solar energy harnesses the power of the sun using photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. It's clean, abundant, and can be utilized in various applications, from residential solar panels to large-scale solar farms. However, it is intermittent and dependent on weather conditions.</div>

            <div class="header">2. Wind Energy</div>
            <div class="text">Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity. Wind energy is abundant, produces no emissions during operation, and has low operational costs. On the downside, it's variable, and the construction and maintenance of wind turbines can have an environmental impact.</div>

            <div class="header">3. Hydropower</div>
            <div class="text">Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, generates electricity by utilizing the energy of flowing water. It's a reliable source, with long lifespans for hydroelectric plants. However, it can disrupt local ecosystems and fish habitats, and dams have significant environmental implications.</div>

            <div class="header">4. Geothermal Energy</div>
            <div class="text">Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat. It's a constant and reliable source of energy. Geothermal power plants have a small environmental footprint but are location-dependent, only available in geothermal hotspots.</div>

            <div class="header">Non-Renewable Energy Sources</div>
            <div class="text">Non-renewable energy sources are finite and deplete as they're used. They often have higher environmental impacts and contribute to climate change. Here are some common examples:</div>

            <div class="header">1. Fossil Fuels</div>
            <div class="text">Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, have been the primary energy sources for decades. They're energy-dense and cost-effective but produce greenhouse gas emissions, leading to air pollution and climate change. These sources are finite, and their extraction can have significant environmental impacts.</div>

            <div class="header">2. Nuclear Energy</div>
            <div class="text">Nuclear energy relies on the fission of uranium or plutonium atoms to generate electricity. It produces large amounts of energy and has low greenhouse gas emissions but comes with safety concerns, radioactive waste management, and the potential for accidents.</div>

            <div class="header">3. Natural Gas</div>
            <div class="text">Natural gas is a versatile fossil fuel often used for electricity generation and heating. It's cleaner than coal and oil but still emits carbon dioxide when burned. Extraction methods like hydraulic fracturing (fracking) can lead to environmental issues.</div>

            <div class="header">Energy Sources in General</div>
            <div class="text">Our energy landscape is evolving as we seek more sustainable and environmentally friendly sources. The transition to renewable energy is driven by concerns about climate change, air quality, and resource depletion. Renewable sources are gaining prominence due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and limit environmental impacts. Energy efficiency, conservation, and responsible energy consumption are also vital components of a sustainable energy future.</div>
