            <div class="header">Finding the Roots of a Cubic Graph</div>
            <div class="text">The roots of a cubic graph, also known as the solutions or x-intercepts, are the values of x where the graph crosses the x-axis (y = 0). There are several methods to find these roots, and one of the most effective methods is the division method. Let's explore how to find the roots of a cubic graph using this method, as well as briefly mention other approaches.</div>

            <div class="header">Division Method</div>
            <div class="text">1. **Finding One Root:** To begin, let's find one root of the cubic equation f(x) = 0, basically trying to find a value where x in the equation will equal 0. This is often done through educated guessing, graphical analysis, or by using a numeric solver. Once you have one root, let's call it "a," you know that (x - a) is a factor of the cubic equation.</div>
            <div class="text">2. **Dividing the Cubic Equation:** Using synthetic division or <a class="link" href="../polynomial-long-division/index.html">polynomial long division</a>, divide the cubic equation by (x - a). This will result in a quadratic equation, which is easier to solve for its remaining roots.</div>
            <div class="text">3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** The quadratic equation obtained from the division should be in the form of axÂ² + bx + c = 0. You can use the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square to solve for the remaining two roots. Remember that a quadratic equation can have two real roots, one real root (a repeated root), or two complex roots.</div>

            <div class="header">Other Methods</div>
            <div class="text">In addition to the division method, there are other methods to find the roots of a cubic graph:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Graphical Analysis: Graph the cubic function and identify the x-intercepts where the graph crosses the x-axis. This method is less precise but provides a visual representation.</li>
              <li>Numeric Solvers: Use numerical methods or software to find approximate solutions for the roots. These methods are suitable for complex equations.</li>
              <li>Factor Theorem: If you already know a factor of the cubic equation, you can use synthetic division to find the remaining roots, similar to the division method.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <div class="text">The division method is particularly useful when you've found one root and want to simplify the process of finding the other roots. Remember to consider both real and complex roots when solving cubic equations.</div>

            <div class="text">By using these methods, you can effectively find the roots of a cubic graph, allowing you to analyze and understand the behavior of the function.</div>
