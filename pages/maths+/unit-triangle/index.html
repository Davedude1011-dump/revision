            <div class="header">Trigonometric Ratios in a Unit Triangle</div>

            <div class="text">In trigonometry, the unit triangle, also known as the right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 1, provides a foundation for understanding key trigonometric ratios. Let's explore these relationships:</div>

            <div class="header">Sine (sin θ)</div>
            <div class="text">Sine is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle (opposite side) to the hypotenuse. In the unit triangle, sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse. Therefore, sin θ = a/1 = a, where 'a' is the length of the opposite side.</div>

            <div class="header">Cosine (cos θ)</div>
            <div class="text">Cosine is defined as the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle (adjacent side) to the hypotenuse. In the unit triangle, cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse. Therefore, cos θ = b/1 = b, where 'b' is the length of the adjacent side.</div>

            <div class="header">Tangent (tan θ)</div>
            <div class="text">Tangent is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle. In the unit triangle, tan θ = opposite/adjacent. Therefore, tan θ = a/b, where 'a' is the length of the opposite side and 'b' is the length of the adjacent side.</div>

            <div class="header">Reciprocal Relationships</div>
            <div class="text">These trigonometric ratios establish fundamental relationships between the sides of a right-angled triangle and its angles. Understanding these ratios is essential for solving trigonometric problems and working with angles in various mathematical contexts.</div>
