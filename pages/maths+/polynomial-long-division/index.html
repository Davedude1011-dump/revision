            <div class="header">Polynomial Long Division</div>
            <div class="text">Polynomial long division is a method used to divide one polynomial by another, just as you would divide numbers in long division. This process allows you to find the quotient and remainder when dividing a polynomial by another polynomial.</div>

            <div class="header">The Process</div>
            <div class="text">To perform polynomial long division, follow these steps:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Divide the first term of the dividend (the polynomial you're dividing) by the first term of the divisor (the polynomial you're dividing by). This gives you the first term of the quotient.</li>
              <li>Multiply the divisor by the first term of the quotient and subtract it from the dividend.</li>
              <li>Bring down the next term of the dividend, and repeat the process to find the next term of the quotient.</li>
              <li>Continue this process until you've divided all the terms of the dividend.</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            <div class="text">Polynomial long division is a valuable technique when dealing with polynomial expressions, particularly when you need to find the roots of a polynomial or simplify complex expressions. It's a fundamental skill in algebra and can be used to solve various mathematical problems.</div>

            <div class="text">For a detailed example and further information on polynomial long division, you can refer to the video shown below:</div>
