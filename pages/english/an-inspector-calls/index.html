            <div class="header">Introduction</div>
            <div class="text">"An Inspector Calls" by J.B. Priestley is a classic play set in the fictional town of Brumley during 1912. The plot unfolds during a single night at the Birling family home, where a mysterious Inspector Goole disrupts their celebration, leading to a revelation of deep-seated secrets and moral reckoning.</div>

            <div class="header">Act 1: The Engagement Dinner</div>
            <div class="text">The play commences with the Birlings celebrating Sheila's engagement. This act establishes the Edwardian setting, the family's bourgeois values, and introduces the enigmatic Inspector Goole. Arthur Birling's confident predictions about the future and the imminent arrival of the Inspector set the tone for the unfolding drama.</div>

            <div class="header">Act 2: Interrogations and Revelations</div>
            <div class="text">Inspector Goole systematically interrogates each family member about their connections to Eva Smith, a deceased woman. As the characters reveal their involvement in Eva's life, tensions rise. Sheila's realization of her role in Eva's tragedy adds a layer of guilt and remorse to the family dynamic.</div>

            <div class="header">Act 3: The Climax and Resolution</div>
            <div class="text">The climax centers on the revelation of Eva Smith's death and the impact of the characters' actions. The Inspector's impassioned speech about social responsibility confronts the family with their collective guilt. However, the unexpected twist in the denouement raises questions about the true identity and purpose of Inspector Goole.</div>

            <div class="header">Themes and Motifs</div>
            <div class="text">"An Inspector Calls" explores several themes, including social responsibility, class distinctions, and morality. The motif of time is recurrent, emphasizing the inevitability of consequences and the interconnectedness of past and present actions.</div>

            <div class="header">Character Analysis</div>
            <div class="text">The characters represent distinct societal archetypes. Arthur Birling embodies capitalist arrogance, Mrs. Birling portrays the unyielding upper-class matron, Sheila symbolizes transformation and empathy, and Eric represents the pitfalls of unchecked behavior. Inspector Goole functions as an allegorical figure challenging the characters' moral fiber.</div>

            <div class="header">Symbolism and Imagery</div>
            <div class="text">Symbolism is prevalent throughout the play. The Birling family home symbolizes societal insulation, while the Inspector represents collective conscience. The engagement ring becomes a powerful emblem, reflecting societal expectations and the cyclical nature of responsibility.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion: Societal Critique</div>
            <div class="text">Priestley employs "An Inspector Calls" as a scathing critique of Edwardian society, exposing its moral shortcomings and class-based prejudices. The play serves as a timeless reminder of the consequences of indifference and the need for societal accountability.</div>
