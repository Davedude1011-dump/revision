            <div class="header">Introduction to Quadratic Equations</div>
            <div class="text">A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation with the general form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, and x represents the variable. Quadratic equations often appear in various fields of mathematics, science, and engineering due to their widespread applicability. They describe many real-world phenomena and are a fundamental topic in algebra.</div>

            <div class="header">Structure of Quadratic Equations</div>
            <div class="text">Quadratic equations have a specific structure. The term "quadratic" originates from the Latin word "quadratus," meaning square, which is fitting as x^2 is a prominent component. The equation's parts serve distinct roles: a represents the coefficient of the x^2 term, b represents the coefficient of the x term, and c is a constant term. The solutions to the equation, or roots, are the values of x that satisfy it.</div>

            <div class="header">Why Quadratic Equations Have Two Answers</div>
            <div class="text">Quadratic equations typically have two solutions, also known as roots. This is due to the fact that when graphed, a quadratic equation forms a parabola, and it intersects the x-axis at two distinct points in most cases. These solutions correspond to the x-values where the equation equals zero.</div>

            <div class="header">Benefits of Factoring</div>
            <div class="text">Factoring is a method used to simplify quadratic equations and express them as a product of two binomials, such as (x - p)(x - q). Factoring is valuable for solving quadratic equations and can provide insights into their solutions. It can also help in finding critical points and graphing the associated parabola.</div>

            <div class="header">Completing the Square</div>
            <div class="text">Completing the square is another technique used to manipulate quadratic equations. It involves transforming the equation into a perfect square trinomial, which can simplify the process of solving it. Completing the square is particularly useful for finding the vertex form of a quadratic equation.</div>

            <div class="header">Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations</div>
            <div class="text">There are various methods for solving quadratic equations, including factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is a widely applicable approach that provides the roots of a quadratic equation directly. Each method offers advantages and can be chosen based on the specific characteristics of the equation.</div>

            <div class="header">Graphical Representation</div>
            <div class="text">On a graph, quadratic equations correspond to parabolas. The direction, position, and shape of the parabola are determined by the coefficients in the equation. The solutions are where the parabola intersects the x-axis, and the vertex of the parabola is a critical point that often has real-world significance.</div>

            <div class="header">Applications in Various Fields</div>
            <div class="text">Quadratic equations have numerous applications in diverse fields, including physics, engineering, accounting, and economics. They are used to model various real-world scenarios, such as motion, optimization problems, and financial analysis. Understanding quadratic equations is essential for professionals in these fields.</div>
