            <div class="header">Completing the Square with a Coefficient of 1</div>
            <div class="text">Completing the square is a method used to rewrite a quadratic expression in the form (x + p)^2 + q, where 'p' and 'q' are constants. This process is particularly valuable when the coefficient of the quadratic term (x^2) is 1. Completing the square allows you to simplify solving equations, find the vertex of a parabola, and graph quadratic functions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to complete the square:</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Step 1: Begin with a Standard Quadratic Expression</div>
            <div class="text">Start with a quadratic expression in the form: x^2 + bx + c, where the coefficient of the quadratic term (x^2) is 1. If it's not 1, factor it out. For example, if you have 2x^2, factor out the 2 to get 1x^2 (x^2).</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Step 2: Identify 'p' and 'q'</div>
            <div class="text">Calculate 'p' by taking half of the coefficient of the linear term 'bx' (i.e., p = b/2). To find 'q,' square 'p' (i.e., q = p^2). These constants 'p' and 'q' will help you create a perfect square trinomial within the expression.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Step 3: Rewrite the Expression</div>
            <div class="text">To complete the square, you need to rewrite the expression in the form (x + p)^2 + q. Add or subtract 'q' within the original expression to maintain its equality. The new form will be in the format of a perfect square trinomial.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Step 4: Example in Algebra</div>
            <div class="text">Let's complete the square for the algebraic expression: x^2 + 6x. First, identify 'p' and 'q.' Here, p = 6/2 = 3, and q = 3^2 = 9. Now, rewrite the expression as (x + 3)^2 - 9.</div>
                    
            <div class="text">Another important aspect of completing the square is the ability to find the roots of a quadratic equation. The roots, or solutions, correspond to the x-values where the quadratic expression equals zero. In the case of (x + 3)^2 - 9, to find the roots, set the expression equal to zero and solve for 'x.'</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Step 5: Example with Numbers</div>
            <div class="text">Consider a quadratic expression with numbers: x^2 + 10x. Find 'p' and 'q.' In this case, p = 10/2 = 5, and q = 5^2 = 25. Rewrite the expression as (x + 5)^2 - 25.</div>
                    
            <div class="text">As an application, when the quadratic expression represents the height of an object in free fall, finding the roots can help determine the time it takes for the object to hit the ground.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Applications and Benefits</div>
            <div class="text">Completing the square is widely used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields. It simplifies the process of solving quadratic equations, finding the vertex of parabolas, graphing quadratic functions, and optimizing real-world problems.</div>
