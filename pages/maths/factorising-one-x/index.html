            <div class="header">Factorising Quadratics with a Coefficient of One</div>
            <div class="text">When you have a quadratic equation in the form x^2 + bx + c, where the coefficient of x^2 is 1, you can factorise it to find the expressions that, when multiplied, give you the quadratic expression. Factorisation allows you to rewrite the quadratic in the form (x + ...)(x + ...), which reveals its roots.</div>

            <div class="header">Trial and Error Method</div>
            <div class="text">The trial and error method is a straightforward approach to factorising. To use this method, you need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (c) and add up to the coefficient of the middle term (b). These numbers will help you rewrite the quadratic expression as (x + ...)(x + ...).</div>

            <div class="text">For example, consider the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6. You can identify the numbers 2 and 3 that meet the criteria. This allows you to rewrite the expression as (x + 2)(x + 3).</div>

            <div class="header">Examples</div>
            <div class="text">Let's explore the trial and error method with a few examples. Consider the expression x^2 + 7x + 12. Using this method, you can find that 3 and 4 are suitable numbers. This leads to the factorisation (x + 3)(x + 4).</div>

            <div class="text">Now, take the expression x^2 - 6x - 16. By identifying the numbers 2 and 8, you can rewrite it as (x - 8)(x + 2).</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Factorising quadratics with a coefficient of one using the trial and error method is a fundamental skill in algebra. It helps you express the quadratic in the form (x + ...)(x + ...), revealing its roots. Understanding this technique is crucial for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.</div>
