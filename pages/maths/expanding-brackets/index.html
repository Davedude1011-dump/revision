            <div class="header">Understanding Expanding Brackets</div>
            <div class="text">Expanding brackets is a fundamental algebraic technique used to simplify expressions and solve equations. It involves distributing terms outside the brackets to every term inside, resulting in a more manageable and often simplified expression.</div>
            <div class="text">This technique plays a significant role in algebra, calculus, and various mathematical applications, enabling the manipulation of equations, polynomial expressions, and real-world problems.</div>

            <div class="header">Expanding Brackets with a Single Term</div>
            <div class="text">Expanding brackets with a single term involves multiplying each term inside the brackets by the term outside the brackets.</div>
            <div class="text">For example, consider the expression 2(3x + 4):</div>
            <div class="text">To expand the brackets, multiply 2 by each term inside:</div>
            <div class="text">2(3x + 4) = 2 * 3x + 2 * 4 = 6x + 8</div>
            <div class="text">The final expanded expression is 6x + 8.</div>

            <div class="header">Expanding Brackets with Binomials</div>
            <div class="text">Expanding brackets with binomials involves multiplying each term of one binomial expression by each term of the other. This process is commonly referred to as the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last).</div>
            <div class="text">For example, consider the expression (x + 2)(x - 3):</div>
            <div class="text">Apply the FOIL method:</div>
            <div class="text">First: x * x = x^2</div>
            <div class="text">Outer: x * (-3) = -3x</div>
            <div class="text">Inner: 2 * x = 2x</div>
            <div class="text">Last: 2 * (-3) = -6</div>
            <div class="text">Now, combine these terms:</div>
            <div class="text">(x + 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6</div>
            <div class="text">Simplify further:</div>
            <div class="text">x^2 - x - 6</div>
            <div class="text">The final expanded expression is x^2 - x - 6.</div>

            <div class="header">Applications of Expanding Brackets</div>
            <div class="text">Expanding brackets is widely used in various mathematical and real-world scenarios:</div>
            <div class="text">1. Algebraic Equations: Expanding brackets is essential when solving equations, simplifying expressions, and isolating variables. It allows you to manipulate equations to find solutions.</div>
            <div class="text">2. Polynomial Manipulation: Expanding brackets is used to simplify polynomial expressions and perform operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials.</div>
            <div class="text">3. Geometry: In geometry, expanding brackets is used to calculate areas, volumes, and perimeters of shapes by breaking them into simpler components.</div>
            <div class="text">4. Economics: In economics, expanding brackets is employed to model and analyze various economic scenarios, including revenue and cost functions.</div>
            <div class="text">5. Physics: Expanding brackets is applied in physics to simplify equations representing physical phenomena and to find relationships between variables.</div>
            <div class="text">Overall, understanding how to expand brackets is a fundamental skill in mathematics and science, enabling problem-solving and the simplification of complex expressions in diverse fields.</div>
