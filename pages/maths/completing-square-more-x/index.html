            <div class="header">Completing the Square with a Coefficient Greater than 1</div>
            <div class="text">When you encounter a quadratic expression with a coefficient greater than 1 for the x^2 term, it's often beneficial to divide the entire expression by that coefficient before completing the square. This simplifies the process and allows you to obtain the square form more easily. Here's how to do it:</div>

            <div class="header">Step 1: Divide by the Coefficient of x^2</div>
            <div class="text">Begin with the quadratic expression, which might look like ax^2 + bx + c, where 'a' is the coefficient of x^2. To remove this coefficient, divide the entire expression by 'a.' This results in the expression x^2 + (b/a)x + (c/a).</div>

            <div class="header">Step 2: Completing the Square</div>
            <div class="text">Now that you have the expression in the form x^2 + (b/a)x + (c/a), proceed with the steps for completing the square, as described in the previous section. Find 'p' and 'q,' rewrite the expression as a perfect square trinomial, and ensure it is in the form (x + p)^2 + q.</div>

            <div class="header">Step 3: Reintroduce the Coefficient</div>
            <div class="text">Once you have the expression in the square form (x + p)^2 + q, reintroduce the coefficient 'a' by multiplying it back into the equation. This yields the completed square form: a(x + p)^2 + aq.</div>

            <div class="header">Example in Algebra</div>
            <div class="text">Let's work through an example with the expression 2x^2 + 12x + 18. First, divide by the coefficient 'a' (2), which results in x^2 + 6x + 9. Find 'p' and 'q,' where p = 6/2 = 3 and q = 3^2 = 9. Rewrite the expression as (x + 3)^2 + 9. Finally, reintroduce the coefficient 'a' (2) to get the completed square form: 2(x + 3)^2 + 18.</div>

            <div class="text">Completing the square in this manner simplifies solving quadratic equations and is useful for finding the vertex of a parabola, graphing quadratic functions, and optimizing real-world problems where the coefficient is involved.</div>
