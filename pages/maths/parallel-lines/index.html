            <div class="header">Parallel Lines</div>
            <div class="text">In geometry, two lines are said to be parallel if they never intersect, no matter how far they extend in both directions. Parallel lines have some distinct properties and can be identified based on these characteristics.</div>

            <div class="header">Properties of Parallel Lines</div>
            <div class="text">1. Equal Slopes: The slopes (gradients) of parallel lines are equal. If two lines have the same slope, they are parallel.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Never Intersect: Parallel lines do not intersect at any point along their lengths.</div>

            <div class="text">3. Equidistant: The distance between any two points on one line to the corresponding points on the other line is constant. In other words, the lines are always the same distance apart.</div>

            <div class="header">Identifying Parallel Lines</div>
            <div class="text">To determine if two lines are parallel, you can follow these methods:</div>

            <div class="text">1. Calculate Slopes: Find the slopes of both lines. If the slopes are equal, the lines are parallel.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Use the Angle Criteria: If two lines are intersected by a transversal (a line that intersects both lines), and the corresponding angles formed are equal, then the lines are parallel. This is known as the "corresponding angles postulate."</div>

            <div class="text">3. Equidistant Points: If you have multiple points on one line, and the distance from each of those points to the other line is the same, then the lines are parallel.</div>

            <div class="header">Finding a Parallel Line Through a Specific Point</div>
            <div class="text">Sometimes, you may need to find a parallel line to a given line that passes through a particular point. Here's how you can do it:</div>

            <div class="text">1. Determine the Slope: First, find the slope of the given line. You can do this by examining its equation. Let's say the slope of the given line is **m**.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Use the Point-Slope Form: The equation of a line in point-slope form is given as:</div>

            <div class="text">**y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)**</div>

            <div class="text">Where:</div>

            <div class="text">- **(x₁, y₁)** is the specific point you want the parallel line to pass through.</div>

            <div class="text">- **m** is the slope of the given line.</div>

            <div class="text">3. Plug in Values: Substitute the values of the specific point **(x₁, y₁)** and the slope **m** into the point-slope equation.</div>

            <div class="text">4. Solve for **y**: After plugging in the values, you can solve for **y** to get the equation of the parallel line.</div>

            <div class="header">Example</div>
            <div class="text">Given a line with the equation **y = 3x + 2**, find the equation of a parallel line that passes through the point **(4, 6)**.</div>

            <div class="text">1. Determine the Slope: The slope of the given line is **3**.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Use the Point-Slope Form:</div>

            <div class="text">**y - 6 = 3(x - 4)**</div>

            <div class="text">3. Plug in Values:</div>

            <div class="text">**y - 6 = 3(x - 4)**</div>

            <div class="text">4. Solve for **y**:</div>

            <div class="text">**y - 6 = 3x - 12**</div>
            <div class="text">**y = 3x - 12 + 6**</div>
            <div class="text">**y = 3x - 6**</div>

            <div class="text">So, the equation of the parallel line passing through the point **(4, 6)** is **y = 3x - 6**.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Finding a parallel line through a specific point involves using the point-slope form of the line equation. By knowing the slope of the given line and the desired point, you can easily determine the equation of the parallel line that meets your criteria.</div>
