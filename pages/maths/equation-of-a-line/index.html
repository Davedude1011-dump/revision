            <div class="header">Equation of a Line</div>
            <div class="text">In mathematics, the equation of a line is a fundamental concept used to describe a straight line's relationship between its coordinates, usually represented as (x, y) on a Cartesian plane. The equation of a line typically takes the form:</div>

            <div class="text">**y = mx + b**</div>

            <div class="header">Understanding the Components</div>
            <div class="text">Let's break down the components of this equation:</div>

            <div class="text">- **y:** This represents the vertical position (ordinate) of a point on the line.</div>

            <div class="text">- **x:** This denotes the horizontal position (abscissa) of the point.</div>

            <div class="text">- **m:** Known as the slope, it indicates the line's steepness or inclination. It defines how much y changes for a given change in x. A positive slope means the line rises as you move from left to right, while a negative slope signifies a downward trend.</div>

            <div class="text">- **b:** The y-intercept represents the point where the line intersects the y-axis (x = 0). It is the value of y when x is zero.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Equations of Lines</div>
            <div class="text">Different forms of the equation of a line exist, each serving specific purposes:</div>

            <div class="text">- **Point-Slope Form:** The equation can also be expressed as **y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)**, where (x₁, y₁) is a point on the line. This form is useful when you have a specific point and the slope.</div>

            <div class="text">- **Slope-Intercept Form:** The most common form is **y = mx + b**, which is used when you know the slope and y-intercept.</div>

            <div class="text">- **General Form:** The general form of a line's equation is **Ax + By = C**, where A, B, and C are constants. This form allows for any straight line, including vertical and horizontal lines.</div>

            <div class="header">Rearranging the Equation</div>
            <div class="text">You can rearrange the equation of a line to solve for different variables:</div>

            <div class="text">- **Solving for y:** If you know the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b), you can rearrange the equation to find y. For example: **y = mx + b**.</div>

            <div class="text">- **Solving for x:** In some cases, you may need to find the x-coordinate of a point on the line. Rearrange the equation to isolate x: **x = (y - b) / m**.</div>

            <div class="text">- **Solving for m or b:** If you have two points on the line, you can rearrange the equation to find the slope (m) or y-intercept (b). For example, to find the slope: **m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)**.</div>

            <div class="header">Graphical Representation</div>
            <div class="text">Graphing the equation of a line on a Cartesian plane helps visualize its characteristics. The slope (m) determines the line's steepness, while the y-intercept (b) indicates where it crosses the y-axis. By plotting two points or using the slope and a single point, you can draw a line accurately.</div>

            <div class="header">Applications</div>
            <div class="text">Equations of lines are widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and geometry. They are essential for modeling relationships between variables, predicting trends, and solving practical problems involving linear relationships.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Understanding the equation of a line is fundamental in mathematics and has practical applications in many disciplines. Whether describing the trajectory of a projectile, analyzing economic trends, or solving geometric problems, the equation of a line provides a powerful tool for describing linear relationships in a two-dimensional space.</div>
