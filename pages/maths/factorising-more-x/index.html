            <div class="header">Factorising Quadratics with a Coefficient Greater than One</div>
            <div class="text">When dealing with quadratic equations in the form ax^2 + bx + c, where 'a' is a coefficient greater than one, you can factorise them into the format (x + ...)(x + ...). Two common methods for achieving this are:</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Method 1: Splitting the Middle Term</div>
            <div class="text">One approach is to split the middle term (bx) into two terms that sum up to 'bx.' This helps in breaking down the quadratic expression into two separate binomials that can be factored.</div>
                    
            <div class="text">For example, let's take the quadratic expression 2x^2 + 7x + 3. To factorise it, we look for two numbers that multiply to the product of 'a' and 'c' (2 * 3 = 6) and add up to 'b' (7). These numbers are 6 and 1. Using this, we can rewrite the expression as (2x^2 + 6x + x + 3). Now, factor the expression in pairs: 2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3). Finally, group the common terms and factorise to get (2x + 1)(x + 3).</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Method 2: Trial and Error</div>
            <div class="text">Another approach is the trial and error method, similar to the one used when the coefficient is one. Here, you need to find two numbers that multiply to 'a * c' and add up to 'b.'</div>
                    
            <div class="text">For instance, consider the quadratic 3x^2 - 8x - 4. To factorise, look for two numbers that multiply to -12 (3 * -4) and add up to -8. These numbers are -12 and 1. You can rewrite the expression as 3x^2 - 12x + 4x - 4 and then factorise it in pairs: 3x(x - 4) + 4(x - 1). Combine the common terms and factorise to get (3x + 4)(x - 1).</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Factorising quadratics with coefficients greater than one may seem complex, but methods like splitting the middle term and trial and error can make it more manageable. The goal is to transform the quadratic expression into the format (x + ...)(x + ...), revealing its factors and helping in problem-solving.</div>
