            <div class="header">Understanding Bearings</div>
            <div class="text">Bearings are a way to describe the direction of one point or object from another point, typically in relation to the north direction. Bearings are commonly used in navigation, engineering, and various applications where direction matters.</div>

            <div class="header">Rules for Bearings</div>
            <div class="text">To use bearings effectively, you should keep these rules in mind:</div>

            <div class="text">1. Bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction. North corresponds to 0 degrees, east to 90 degrees, south to 180 degrees, and west to 270 degrees.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Bearings are always expressed as three-digit angles. For example, 045° represents northeast, and 270° stands for due west.</div>

            <div class="text">3. When calculating bearings, make sure to measure the angle from the starting point (A) to the destination point (B) in a clockwise direction. This is the bearing of B from A.</div>

            <div class="text">4. Bearings are typically rounded to the nearest whole degree unless specified otherwise.</div>

            <div class="text">5. If the bearing is less than 100 degrees, it should be written with leading zeros. For example, 045° instead of 45°.</div>

            <div class="header">Calculating Bearings</div>
            <div class="text">To calculate the bearing of point B from point A, follow these steps:</div>

            <div class="text">1. Determine the direction from point A to point B using a compass or map. This direction is the angle measured clockwise from north.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Convert this angle to a three-digit bearing, rounding to the nearest whole degree if necessary.</div>

            <div class="text">3. Express the bearing as a three-digit angle, ensuring it has leading zeros if it's less than 100 degrees.</div>

            <div class="text">For example, if point B is located northeast of point A, the bearing of B from A would be 045°.</div>

            <div class="header">Applications of Bearings</div>
            <div class="text">Bearings find applications in various fields, including navigation, aviation, surveying, and engineering. They are crucial for determining the direction between two points and are essential for accurate navigation and positioning.</div>

            <div class="header">Practice Example</div>
            <div class="text">Let's practice calculating a bearing: Point B is located southeast of Point A. What is the bearing of B from A?</div>

            <div class="text">1. Determine the angle from A to B. In this case, it's 40 degrees clockwise from north.</div>

            <div class="text">2. Express the bearing as a three-digit angle with leading zeros. So, the bearing of B from A is 40°.</div>

            <div class="text">That's how you calculate bearings in simple scenarios. Practice and experience will help you become proficient in using bearings for more complex situations.</div>
