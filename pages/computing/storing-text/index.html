            <div class="header">Storing Text in Computing</div>
            <div class="text">In the world of computing, text is stored and processed as a series of characters. These characters can represent letters, numbers, symbols, and control codes. The process of storing and manipulating text is fundamental to various applications, from word processing to web development. Key components that allow this to happen include keyboards and character encoding standards.</div>

            <div class="header">Keyboards and Text Entry</div>
            <div class="text">Keyboards are the primary input devices for entering text into a computer. When you type on a keyboard, each keypress generates a specific signal that is sent to the computer. These signals are typically encoded using character encoding standards, which allow the computer to understand and interpret the keypresses as specific characters.</div>

            <div class="header">Character Encoding Standards</div>
            <div class="text">Character encoding standards are essential for converting human-readable text into a format that computers can understand. The most widely used standards include ASCII, ASCII Extended, and Unicode:</div>

            <div class="header">1. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</div>
            <div class="text">ASCII is one of the oldest character encoding standards. It uses a 7-bit encoding system, representing 128 characters, including the English alphabet, numbers, punctuation, and control characters. Each character is assigned a unique numeric value, allowing computers to recognize and display text. However, ASCII is limited to the English language and lacks support for special characters from other languages.</div>

            <div class="header">2. ASCII Extended</div>
            <div class="text">ASCII Extended, also known as ISO 8859, expands upon the original ASCII standard. It includes additional characters and symbols to support various languages, such as accented letters used in European languages. Different versions of ASCII Extended are available to cater to specific language requirements. These standards use 8-bit encoding, allowing for 256 characters, which is sufficient for most Western languages.</div>

            <div class="header">3. Unicode</div>
            <div class="text">Unicode is a comprehensive character encoding standard that aims to cover virtually all characters from all writing systems in the world. It uses a 16-bit encoding system, which means it can represent up to 65,536 characters. Unicode ensures a consistent and universal approach to character encoding, enabling computers to display text in multiple languages, including those with complex scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Devanagari.</div>

            <div class="header">Text Representation and Storage</div>
            <div class="text">Text is stored in computers as sequences of bytes, with each character encoded using the chosen character encoding standard. When text is displayed, the computer retrieves the bytes and decodes them into human-readable characters, ensuring that the text appears correctly on the screen. The selection of the appropriate character encoding standard is critical to correctly represent and display text, especially when working with multiple languages and scripts.</div>
