            <div class="header">Chapter 1: Introduction to Binary Shifting</div>
            <div class="text">Binary shifting is a fundamental operation in computer science and digital electronics, used for various purposes. It involves moving the bits of a binary number to the left (left shift) or right (right shift). These operations are essential for optimizing code, data manipulation, and more.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 2: Left Shift (<<)</div>
            <div class="text">Left shifting is a powerful operation in binary arithmetic. It involves shifting the bits of a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions. This effectively multiplies the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count. We'll explore left shifting mechanics, applications, and practical examples.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 3: Right Shift (>>)</div>
            <div class="text">Right shifting is another essential operation in binary mathematics. It entails moving the bits of a binary number to the right, effectively dividing it by 2 raised to the power of the shift count. Right shifts are used for various tasks, including integer division by powers of two and code optimization. We'll delve into right shifting in detail, covering signed and unsigned right shifts.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 4: Logical vs. Arithmetic Shifts</div>
            <div class="text">In binary shifting, there are two primary types of right shifts: logical and arithmetic. Logical shifts insert zeros into the vacant bit positions created by the shift, maintaining the sign for positive and negative numbers. On the other hand, arithmetic shifts preserve the sign and replicate the sign bit in the vacant positions. We'll provide examples and practical insights into when to use each type.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 5: Circular Shifts</div>
            <div class="text">Circular shifts, also known as rotation, involve shifting bits while wrapping around. This operation has applications in cryptography and data manipulation. We'll discuss how circular shifts work and provide examples to illustrate their use.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 6: Bitwise Operations and Shifting</div>
            <div class="text">Binary shifting is often used in combination with bitwise operations like AND, OR, and XOR. These operations, combined with shifting, enable precise manipulation of binary data. We'll explore practical scenarios where bitwise operations and shifting play a crucial role in computer programming and data processing.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 7: Application in Data Compression</div>
            <div class="text">Binary shifting is integral to data compression algorithms like Huffman coding and Run-Length Encoding (RLE). We'll discuss how shifting techniques are employed to reduce the size of data for efficient storage and transmission. Real-world examples of data compression will illustrate the impact of binary shifting.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 8: Hardware Implementation</div>
            <div class="text">Binary shifting is implemented in computer hardware using shift registers and logical gates. In this chapter, we'll explore how hardware circuits perform binary shifts and their role in processors, memory devices, and other digital components. Understanding hardware implementation is crucial for computer engineers and hardware designers.</div>
