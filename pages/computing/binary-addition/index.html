            <div class="header">Chapter 1: Introduction to Binary Addition</div>
            <div class="text">Binary addition is a core operation in computing, essential for processing digital information. Unlike decimal addition, which uses ten digits, binary addition operates with just two: 0 and 1. We'll dive right into the process of adding binary numbers, understanding that it's a crucial skill for computer science and electronics.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 2: Binary Digits (Bits)</div>
            <div class="text">Binary digits, or bits, are the building blocks of digital information. They represent values as either 0 or 1, mirroring the on-off states of electronic circuits. Bits underpin all computer operations, including binary addition. In this chapter, we explore the significance of bits and their role in binary arithmetic.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 3: Binary Addition Basics</div>
            <div class="text">Binary addition follows straightforward rules: 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1, and 1 + 1 = 0 with a carry of 1. We'll delve into these basics, emphasizing the carry-over mechanism when adding binary digits. This forms the foundation for more complex binary addition.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 4: Binary Addition Examples</div>
            <div class="text">Learning binary addition is best accomplished through examples. We'll provide step-by-step demonstrations of adding binary numbers, covering a range of scenarios from simple additions to cases involving carry-overs. These examples will solidify your understanding of binary addition.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 5: Binary Addition with Overflow</div>
            <div class="text">Sometimes, binary addition leads to overflow, where the sum exceeds the bit capacity. Detecting and addressing overflow is vital in computing. We'll explore overflow scenarios and strategies to handle them effectively, ensuring accurate calculations.</div>

            <div class="header">Chapter 6: Binary Addition in Computers</div>
            <div class="text">Binary addition is the core of computer arithmetic. Modern processors execute billions of binary additions per second. In this chapter, we examine how binary addition is implemented in computer hardware, powering everything from basic calculations to complex algorithms.</div>
