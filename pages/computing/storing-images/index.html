            <div class="header">Storing Images in Computing</div>
            <div class="text">Images are a fundamental part of digital content, and they are stored and processed in various formats. Two primary types of image formats are commonly used in computing: bitmap images and vector graphic images. These formats offer different methods of representing and storing visual information, each with its own set of advantages and limitations.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Bitmap Images</div>
            <div class="text">Bitmap images, also known as raster images, are composed of a grid of individual picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel in a bitmap image is assigned a color value, which defines the image's appearance. Bitmap images are resolution-dependent, meaning that they have a fixed number of pixels, and when you zoom in, you might notice a loss of quality. Here are some key characteristics of bitmap images:</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- Resolution:</div>
            <div class="text">Bitmap images are defined by their resolution, which is usually expressed in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI). Higher resolution images have more pixels per unit of measurement, resulting in greater detail and clarity. Common bitmap image formats include JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- Image Editing:</div>
            <div class="text">Bitmap images are excellent for representing photographs and complex images but may require extensive storage space. They are typically used in photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop. Editing bitmap images often involves altering individual pixel values, which can be precise but time-consuming.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- File Size:</div>
            <div class="text">Bitmap images can have large file sizes, especially at high resolutions. This can impact storage requirements and web page load times. To reduce file sizes, image compression techniques like JPEG and PNG compression are commonly used, which may result in some loss of image quality.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Vector Graphic Images</div>
            <div class="text">Vector graphic images are created using mathematical formulas that define the shapes and lines in the image. Unlike bitmap images, vector graphics are resolution-independent and can be scaled to any size without loss of quality. Here are some key characteristics of vector graphic images:</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- Scalability:</div>
            <div class="text">Vector graphics are highly scalable, making them ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations. Regardless of the size, the shapes and lines in a vector image remain sharp and clear. Common vector graphic formats include SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), AI (Adobe Illustrator), and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript).</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- Editing:</div>
            <div class="text">Vector graphics are typically created and edited using vector graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW. Editing vector images involves manipulating the mathematical formulas that define the shapes, allowing for easy adjustments and modifications.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- File Size:</div>
            <div class="text">Vector graphic files are usually small in size as they store mathematical information, rather than individual pixels. This makes them suitable for web design, where minimizing file size is essential for fast web page loading.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">- Use Cases:</div>
            <div class="text">Vector graphics are commonly used for design and layout work, where precision and scalability are crucial. They are also preferred for tasks like creating logos, icons, and simple illustrations.</div>
                    
            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">The choice between bitmap and vector graphic images depends on the specific requirements of your project. Bitmap images are well-suited for photographs and complex images but may result in larger file sizes. Vector graphics, on the other hand, excel in scalability and precision and are ideal for simpler graphics, logos, and illustrations.</div>
