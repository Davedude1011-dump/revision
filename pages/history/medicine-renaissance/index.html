            <div class="header">Introduction</div>
            <div class="text">The Renaissance, spanning from the 14th to the 17th century, was a period of profound cultural, artistic, and intellectual rebirth. In the realm of medicine, this era witnessed a shift from medieval traditions to a revival of ancient Greek and Roman medical knowledge, fostering advancements in anatomy, surgery, and the understanding of the human body.</div>

            <div class="header">Revival of Ancient Knowledge</div>
            <div class="text">During the Renaissance, there was a resurgence of interest in the works of ancient physicians such as Galen and Hippocrates. Scholars rediscovered and translated classical texts, laying the foundation for a more evidence-based approach to medicine.</div>

            <div class="header">Anatomy and Dissection</div>
            <div class="text">One of the key breakthroughs of the Renaissance was the renewed emphasis on human anatomy. Pioneers like Andreas Vesalius challenged traditional views by conducting systematic dissections, providing more accurate depictions of the human body and its organs.</div>

            <div class="header">Influence of Printing Press</div>
            <div class="text">The invention of the printing press (1440) played a crucial role in disseminating medical knowledge. Medical texts became more widely available, enabling the sharing of ideas and discoveries among scholars and practitioners across Europe.</div>

            <div class="header">Surgery and Innovation</div>
            <div class="text">Advancements in surgical techniques occurred during the Renaissance. Surgeons such as Ambroise Par√© introduced new methods, and the understanding of anatomy improved, contributing to more successful surgical interventions.</div>

            <div class="header">Challenges and Persistence of Traditional Beliefs</div>
            <div class="text">Despite the progress, challenges persisted. The persistence of traditional beliefs, limited technology, and social factors posed obstacles to widespread acceptance of new medical ideas. Additionally, the era saw a continued reliance on Galenic medicine in some regions.</div>

            <div class="header">Legacy and Transition to the Scientific Revolution</div>
            <div class="text">The Renaissance laid the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution that would follow. The emphasis on observation, experimentation, and a critical approach to knowledge marked a significant departure from medieval practices, setting the stage for further medical advancements in the centuries to come.</div>
