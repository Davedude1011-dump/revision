            <div class="header">Introduction</div>
            <div class="text">The medieval period, spanning from the 5th to the 15th century, was marked by a blend of classical knowledge, religious beliefs, and folk traditions. Medical practices during this era were influenced by a combination of ancient texts, superstitions, and a limited understanding of the human body.</div>

            <div class="header">Key Features of Medieval Medicine</div>
            <div class="text">Medieval medicine was characterized by a reliance on traditional theories such as the Four Humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and the concept of the "Doctrine of Signatures," which proposed that plants resembling certain body parts could be used to treat ailments in those areas.</div>

            <div class="header">Role of Physicians and Barber-Surgeons</div>
            <div class="text">Physicians, often university-educated, practiced theoretical medicine based on ancient texts. Barber-surgeons, on the other hand, performed practical procedures like bloodletting, tooth extraction, and minor surgeries. The division between theory and practice persisted throughout the medieval period.</div>

            <div class="header">Herbal Remedies and Folk Medicine</div>
            <div class="text">Herbal remedies were a prevalent form of treatment, with various plants believed to possess healing properties. Folk medicine, guided by local traditions and wise women, played a significant role in providing remedies for common ailments and childbirth.</div>

            <div class="header">Hospitals and Monastic Medicine</div>
            <div class="text">Hospitals in medieval times served as charitable institutions. Monasteries played a crucial role in preserving and transmitting medical knowledge. Monastic infirmaries provided care for the sick and contributed to the development of herbal medicine.</div>

            <div class="header">Challenges and Advances</div>
            <div class="text">Medieval medicine faced challenges such as limited understanding of anatomy, prevalent diseases like the Black Death (1348), and the dominance of traditional beliefs. However, the era laid the groundwork for future medical advancements, with scholars beginning to question and refine medical practices.</div>

            <div class="header">Legacy and Transition to the Renaissance</div>
            <div class="text">The medieval period set the stage for the Renaissance, where a renewed interest in classical knowledge, scientific inquiry, and human anatomy would lead to significant advancements in medicine. Despite its limitations, medieval medicine played a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of medical practices.</div>
