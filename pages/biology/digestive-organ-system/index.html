            <div class="header">The Digestive Organ System</div>
            <div class="text">The digestive system plays a crucial role in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients essential for the body's growth and energy production. It comprises a series of organs and structures working together to facilitate digestion and nutrient absorption.</div>

            <div class="header">1. Mouth</div>
            <div class="text">Digestion begins in the mouth, where food is mechanically broken down through chewing and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains enzymes like amylase, which starts the process of starch digestion. The result is a moistened, partially digested food mixture called chyme.</div>

            <div class="header">2. Pharynx and Esophagus</div>
            <div class="text">After swallowing, the food travels through the pharynx and esophagus. These structures facilitate the movement of food from the mouth to the stomach through a series of coordinated muscular contractions called peristalsis.</div>

            <div class="header">3. Stomach</div>
            <div class="text">The stomach is a muscular organ that further breaks down food, mixing it with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin. These substances create an acidic environment necessary for protein digestion and kill harmful microorganisms. The result is a semiliquid substance called chyme.</div>

            <div class="header">4. Small Intestine</div>
            <div class="text">The small intestine is where most digestion and nutrient absorption occur. It receives chyme from the stomach and mixes it with enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. This combination breaks down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules for absorption into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining.</div>

            <div class="header">5. Liver</div>
            <div class="text">The liver plays a vital role in digestion by producing bile, a substance that emulsifies fats, making them easier to digest and absorb in the small intestine. Additionally, the liver stores and releases glucose, helping to regulate blood sugar levels.</div>

            <div class="header">6. Gallbladder</div>
            <div class="text">The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. When needed, it releases bile into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion.</div>

            <div class="header">7. Pancreas</div>
            <div class="text">The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes, such as amylase, lipase, and protease, into the small intestine to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It also produces insulin and glucagon, hormones involved in blood sugar regulation.</div>

            <div class="header">8. Large Intestine (Colon)</div>
            <div class="text">The large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining chyme, converting it into a more solid form called feces. It also houses beneficial gut bacteria that aid in the fermentation of certain undigested carbohydrates and the synthesis of vitamins.</div>

            <div class="header">Combined Usage</div>
            <div class="text">As food moves through the digestive system, each organ contributes to the breakdown and absorption of nutrients. The mouth initiates mechanical digestion and begins starch digestion. The stomach continues mechanical digestion and initiates protein digestion. The small intestine carries out most digestion and nutrient absorption. The liver and pancreas provide essential enzymes and bile to aid in digestion. Finally, the large intestine reabsorbs water and electrolytes and prepares undigested material for elimination.</div>

            <div class="header">Additional Information</div>
            <div class="text">The digestive process is highly regulated and involves hormones, neural signals, and complex mechanisms to ensure efficient nutrient absorption and waste elimination. Enzymes produced by various organs play specific roles in breaking down macronutrients into forms that can be absorbed by the body.</div>
