            <div class="header">Blood Vessels</div>
            <div class="text">Blood vessels are a crucial part of the circulatory system, responsible for transporting blood throughout the body. They come in different types and sizes, each with specific functions. Understanding blood vessels is essential for comprehending the circulatory system's operation and its role in maintaining overall health.</div>

            <div class="header">Types of Blood Vessels</div>
            <div class="text">There are three main types of blood vessels:</div>
            <img src="https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/artery_med.jpeg" alt="#Artery#" width="60%">
            <div class="text">1. Arteries: Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to various parts of the body. They have thick, muscular walls to withstand high pressure.</div>
            <img src="https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/vein_med.jpeg" alt="#Vein#" width="60%">
            <div class="text">2. Veins: Veins transport deoxygenated blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls and often contain valves to prevent blood from flowing backward.</div>
            <img src="https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/capillaries_med.jpeg" alt="#Capillary#" width="70%">
            <div class="text">3. Capillaries: Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that connect arteries and veins. They facilitate the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between blood and body tissues.</div>

            <div class="header">Arteries</div>
            <div class="text">Arteries play a crucial role in the circulatory system:</div>
            <div class="text">- They carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to various parts of the body.</div>
            <div class="text">- Arteries have thick, elastic walls that help maintain blood pressure and flow.</div>
            <div class="text">- The largest artery in the body is the aorta, which originates from the left ventricle of the heart and branches into numerous smaller arteries.</div>

            <div class="header">Veins</div>
            <div class="text">Veins have distinct characteristics:</div>
            <div class="text">- They transport deoxygenated blood back to the heart, where it can be reoxygenated.</div>
            <div class="text">- Veins typically have thinner walls than arteries and contain valves that prevent the backflow of blood.</div>
            <div class="text">- The superior and inferior vena cava are the two largest veins, returning blood to the heart from the upper and lower parts of the body, respectively.</div>

            <div class="header">Capillaries</div>
            <div class="text">Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels:</div>
            <img src="https://o.quizlet.com/e7YUsdzF6npqk3t5YzfaVA.png" alt="#Capillary Exchange#" width="60%">
            <div class="text">- They connect arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and body tissues.</div>
            <div class="text">- Capillaries are so numerous and tiny that they reach nearly every cell in the body.</div>

            <div class="header">Circulatory System</div>
            <div class="text">The circulatory system relies on a network of blood vessels to maintain the flow of blood, providing oxygen and nutrients to all body cells and removing waste products. The heart pumps blood, which travels through arteries, capillaries, and veins, ensuring the proper functioning of all body systems.</div>
